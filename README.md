# TodoListProject
Creating a simple todo list using basic JavaScript methods.

----- index.html -----

I created a simple index.html page using bootstrap.

----- todo.js -----

I chose the elements using the querySelector method.

I created an eventListeners function that contains addEventListener methods.

I wrote the clearTodos function that deletes all elements from the UI using the removeChild method and deletes all elements from storage using the localStorage.removeItem method.

I wrote the filterTodos function that searches among the todos entered.

I wrote the deleteTodo function that deletes the selected todo using the parentElement method.

I wrote the deleteTodoFromStorage function that deletes the selected todo from storage.

I wrote the controller function in order not to write the todo that was written before.
